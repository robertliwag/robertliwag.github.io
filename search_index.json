Proposition Definition 2.1 A proposition is a statement that is either true or false, but not both. Example 2.1 The following are propositions Today is Thursday. It is raining. The student is in the prescribed uniform. Example 2.2 The following are not propositions Java is the best programming language. How are you doin’? Go home! Exercise 2.1 Which of these are propositions? \\(2 + 2 = 5\\). Every integer is divisible by 3. This University is world-class. Remarks: Propositions are usually denoted by a letter such as \\(p\\), \\(q\\), \\(r\\), \\(s\\), … Propositions are declarative statements. The truth value of a proposition is true, denoted by T, if it is a true proposition, and false, denoted by F, if it is a false proposition. The area of logic that deals with propositions is called propositional calculus or propositional logic. Combining propositions using logical operators (or connectives) forms new proposition called compound proposition. Negation Definition 2.2 Let \\(p\\) be a proposition. The negation of \\(p\\), denoted by \\(\\neg p\\), is the statement: “It is not the case that \\(p\\)”. The truth value of the negation of p, \\(\\neg p\\), is the opposite of the truth value of \\(p\\). Remarks: \\(\\neg p\\), the negation of proposition \\(p\\), is also a proposition. The proposition \\(\\neg p\\) is read as “not \\(p\\).” Examples \\(p:\\) “Today is Monday.” Its negation, \\(\\neg p :\\) “Today is not Monday” is also a proposition. And this can also be stated as \\(\\neg p:\\) “It is not the case that today is Monday.” Let a proposition be: “Johnley’s PC runs Linux.” Its negation is: “It is not the case that Johnley’s PC runs Linux” or “Johnley’s PC does not run Linux.” Find the negation of the proposition: “Amika’s phablet has at least 32GB of memory.” The negation can be expressed in any of the following: “It is not the case that Amika’s phablet has at least 32GB of memory” or “Amika’s phablet does not have at least 32GB of memory” or more precisely, “Amika’s phablet has less than 32GB of memory.” The truth table for the negation operator is \\(\\boldsymbol{p}\\) \\(\\boldsymbol{\\neg p}\\) T F F T Pahabol: Negation is a unary operator. That is, it takes only one proposition to create a new proposition. \\(p\\) is to a set \\(A\\), as \\(\\neg p\\) is to \\(A^c\\). So, consider the domain of the proposition or the universal set of the discourse. Try this. What is the negation of the following quantitative phrases: at most none every less than Lesson 2. Logical Operators (Connectives) Connectives are used to create a compound proposition from two or more propositions. And or logical conjunction (denoted \\(\\wedge\\)) Or or logical disjunction (denoted \\(\\vee\\)) Negation (denoted \\(\\neg\\) or !) XOR or exclusive or (denoted \\(\\oplus\\)) Conditional (denoted \\(\\Rightarrow\\) or \\(\\rightarrow\\)) Biconditional (denoted \\(\\Leftrightarrow\\) or \\(\\leftrightarrow\\)) The meaning (semantics) of the logical connectives is defined by truth tables. Conjunction (Logical And) Definition 2.3 (Conjunction) Let \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) be propositions. The conjunction of \\(p\\) and \\(q\\), denoted by \\(p \\wedge q\\), is the proposition “\\(p\\) and \\(q\\)”. Remarks: The logical connective is true only when both of the propositions are true. It is false, otherwise. The And is a binary operator. The symbol used is \\(\\wedge\\). Its truth table is given by \\(\\boldsymbol{p}\\) \\(\\boldsymbol{q}\\) \\(\\boldsymbol{p \\wedge q}\\) T T T T F F F T F F F F Examples It is raining and my dog is a bitch. \\((2+3 = 5)\\) and \\((1&lt;2)\\). My dog, Dino, is dead and my dog, dino, is not dead. Try this. Find the conjunction of the following propositions: “Amaya’s PC has more than 64 GB free hard disk space” and “The processor speed of Amaya’s PC is more than 1 GHz.” Disjunction (Logical Or) Definition 2.4 (Disjunction) Let \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) be propositions. The disjunction of \\(p\\) and \\(q\\), denoted by \\(p \\vee q\\), is the proposition “\\(p\\) or \\(q\\)” Remarks The logical connective OR is true if one or both of the propositions are true. The symbol used is \\(\\vee\\). It is a binary operator. There are two ways the word or is used in the English language. Inclusive Or. For instance, the statement: “Those who have taken the courses Algebra or Trigonometry may enrol Discrete Math.” Those who have taken Algebra only may enrol Discrete math; Those who have taken Trigonometry only may enrol; Those who have taken both may enrol. Exclusive Or. This is true only if one of the operands is true. For instance, in restaurants, “Group Meal A comes with free soft drinks or Iced tea.” This means You get free soft drinks when you order Group Meal A; You get free Iced tea when you order Group Meal A; You can’t have both free soft drinks and Iced tea when you order Group Meal A.

It is marriage or happiness. Logical Exclusive Or Definition 2.5 (Exclusive Or) Let \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) be propositions. The exclusive or of \\(p\\) and \\(q\\), denoted by \\(p \\oplus q\\), is the proposition that is true when exactly one of \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) is true and is false otherwise. Remarks The symbol used is \\(\\oplus\\). This is a binary operator. This is also known as XOR operator. Examples The circuit is either on or off but not both. Let \\(ab &lt; 0\\), then either \\(a &lt; 0\\) or \\(b &lt; 0\\) but not both. It is freedom or death. Truth table \\(\\boldsymbol{p}\\) \\(\\boldsymbol{q}\\) \\(\\boldsymbol{p \\oplus q}\\) T T F T F T F T T F F F Conditional Statement Definition 2.6 (Conditional statement) Let \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) be propositions. The conditional statement \\[p \\rightarrow q\\] is the proposition “if \\(p\\), then \\(q\\).” In the conditional statement \\(p \\rightarrow q\\), \\(p\\) is called the hypothesis (or antecedent or premise) and \\(q\\) is called the conclusion (or consequence). Remarks \\(p \\rightarrow q\\) is read as “\\(p\\) implies \\(q\\)” This statement is also called an implication. It is a binary operator The statement \\(p \\rightarrow q\\) is false when \\(p\\) is true and \\(q\\) is false, and true otherwise. Truth table \\(\\boldsymbol{p}\\) \\(\\boldsymbol{q}\\) \\(\\boldsymbol{p \\rightarrow q}\\) T T T T F F F T T F F T variants of \\(p \\rightarrow q\\) If \\(p\\) then \\(q\\). If \\(p\\), \\(q\\). \\(p\\) only if \\(q\\). \\(q\\) if \\(p\\). \\(q\\) when \\(p\\). \\(q\\) whenever \\(p\\). \\(q\\) follows from \\(p\\). \\(q\\) unless \\(\\neg p\\) “\\(p\\) is a sufficient condition for \\(q\\)” “a sufficient condition for \\(q\\) is \\(p\\)” “\\(q\\) is a necessary condition for \\(p\\)” “a necessary condition for \\(p\\) is \\(q\\)” Examples If you buy air ticket in advance, it is cheaper. If \\(x\\) is an integer, then \\(x^2 \\geq 0\\). Kapag umulan, basa ang lupa. If the sprinklers operate, the grass gets wet. Pagputi ng uwak, mamahalin kita. If \\(2+2=5\\), then all unicorns are pink. Try this. Which of the following implications is true? If \\(-1\\) is a positive number, then \\(2+2 = 5\\). True. The premise is false, so, no matter what the conclusion is, the implication holds. If \\(-1\\) is a positive number, then \\(2+2 =5\\) Isu met lang a. True! If \\(sin(x) = 0\\), then \\(x = 0\\) False. Although \\(sin(0) = 0\\), there are other values of \\(x\\) that makes \\(sin(x) = 0\\). Biconditional Statement Definition 2.7 (Biconditional statement) Let \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) be propositions. The biconditional statement \\(p \\leftrightarrow q\\) is the proposition “\\(p\\) if and only if \\(q\\)”. The biconditional statement \\(p \\leftrightarrow q\\) is true when \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) have the same truth values, and is false otherwise. Remarks \\(p \\leftrightarrow q\\) can be equivalently read as “\\(p\\) is necessary and sufficient for \\(q\\)” “if \\(p\\) then \\(q\\), and conversely” “\\(p\\) iff \\(q\\)” &quot;if \\(p\\) then \\(q\\), and conversely. The simplest way to remember the truth value of a biconditional statement is contained in the definition: true only when both \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) have the same truth values. Truth table \\(\\boldsymbol{p}\\) \\(\\boldsymbol{q}\\) \\(\\boldsymbol{p \\leftrightarrow q}\\) T T T T F F F T F F F T However, we can look at \\(p \\leftrightarrow q\\) as “\\(p \\rightarrow q\\) and \\(p \\leftarrow q\\)”, thus, the use of the double-sided arrow, \\(\\leftrightarrow\\). (note: \\(p \\rightarrow q\\) is the same as \\(q \\rightarrow p\\)). Therefore, \\(p \\leftrightarrow q \\equiv (p \\rightarrow q) \\wedge (q \\rightarrow p)\\). Using the right-hand side of the above gives the same table. Formal definition of mathematical concepts are biconditional although may not be explicitly stated. Examples For any number \\(x\\), \\(x &gt; 0\\) if and only if \\(x^2\\) is positive. The alarm goes off iff a burglar breaks in. You may have the dessert iff you eat your meal. Try this. Complete the following truth table to verify the identity \\(p \\leftrightarrow q \\equiv (p \\rightarrow q) \\wedge (q \\rightarrow p)\\). \\(\\boldsymbol{p}\\) \\(\\boldsymbol{q}\\) \\(\\boldsymbol{p \\rightarrow q}\\) \\(\\boldsymbol{q \\rightarrow p}\\) \\(\\boldsymbol{(p \\rightarrow q) \\wedge (q \\rightarrow p)}\\) T T T T F F F T F F F T Operator Precedence As in arithmetic, rules of ordering are imposed on the use of logical operators in compound propositions. It is, however, preferable to use parentheses to remove the ambiguity in the expression and facilitate readability. For instance, \\[\\neg p \\vee q \\wedge \\neg r \\equiv (\\neg p) \\vee (q \\wedge (\\neg r)) \\] When no parentheses are used, the precedence heirarchy is used Negation (\\(\\neg\\)) Conjunction (\\(\\wedge\\)) Disjunction (\\(\\vee\\)) Conditional (\\(\\rightarrow\\)) Biconditional (\\(\\leftrightarrow\\)) Examples Lesson 3.
