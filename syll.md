#### V. Course Description: {-} 
This course introduces the foundations of discrete mathematics as they apply to computer science and information technology. Topics include sets, functions, relations, propositional logic, proof techniques, basics of counting and introduction to digital logic and digital system.  It will also begin the process of training the student to argue correctly, both informally and formally, about these structures.  The student will begin to learn the use of abstract analysis to solve concrete problems.

At the end of the course, the students should be able to:

1. State the Vision, Philosophy, Mission, Goals and Objective of the College
2. Define set and perform operations on sets using identities and Venn Diagram.
3. Define functions and relations.
4. Enumerate and apply formal methods of symbolic propositional and predicate logic.
5. Enumerate and apply which kind of proof is best for a given problem.
6. Cite the characteristics of an algorithm and give examples of familiar algorithms.
7. Compute using different methods of counting.
